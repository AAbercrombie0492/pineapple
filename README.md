Jared mentioned some NLP possibilities, maybe time-series. 

Here are some starter ideas:
 - PCA
 - TSNE
 - Text processing (remove stop words, NER, remove punctuation, stem/lemmatize, unicode)
 - bag of words, tidf, word2vec, doc2vec
 - LDA 
 - EDA and plotting scripts. Determine good feature transformations.
 - AR/MA linear regression
 - ETS (forecasting), Holt-Winters Filtering
 - XGboost
 - hypothesis tests 
 - Flask/Shiny app
