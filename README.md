Add your code here. Appar in ently the dataset is going to have something to do with "social impact."
Jared mentioned some NLP possibilities, maybe time-series. 

Here are some starter ideas:

**Statistical Inference/EDA:**
 - Quick visualization and EDA scripts.
 - Kernel Density Estimation
 - nonparametric permutation test
 - general hypothesis tests

**NLP:**
 - Text processing (remove stop words, NER, remove punctuation, stem/lemmatize, unicode)
 - Featurizing: bag of words, tfidf, word2vec, doc2vec
 - Comparing similarity: consine similarity, earth-movers distance, minkowski distance
 - Topic Modeling: LDA (fancy graphlab viz)
 - sentiment analysis
 
**Time Series:**
 - AR/MA linear regression
 - Forecasting: ETS, Holt-Winters Filtering
 - HMMs
 - MCMS: identify pivotal moments (tau) in time-series and get distribution parameters (Poisson, Gaussian)
 
**Dimensionality Reduction:**
- PCA
- TSNE
- Autoencoders

**ML Classification:**
 - XGboost
 - KFold cross-validation with error metrics
 - ROC curve, AUC
 - Confusion matrices
 - Unsupervised Clustering: Kmeans, Gaussian Mixture Models.
 
**Regression:**
 - linear model diagnostics
 - options for l1, l2 regularization. Glmnet/elasticnet
 
**Setup for Flask/Shiny app**
